# Customer-Segmentation

# What is a Customer Segmentation?

Marketing segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, 
normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers 
(known as segments) based on some type of shared characteristics.

# The most common ways in which businesses segment their customer base are:

• Demographic information- such as gender, age, familial and marital status, income, 
education, and occupation.

• Geographical information- which differs depending on the scope of the company. For 
localized businesses, this info might pertain to specific towns or counties. For larger 
companies, it might mean a customer’s city, state, or even country of residence.

• Psychographics- such as social class, lifestyle, and personality traits.

• Behavioral data- such as spending and consumption habits, product/service usage, and 
desired benefits.

# Purpose of Customer Segmentation.

Companies and organizations use customer segmentation to optimize the corporate decisions 
that is derived from deep customer analysis. When used as part of good business practices, a 
company can improve its competitiveness as well as reduce the chances that important decisions 
are not grounded in a deep understanding of existing customer segmentation.
